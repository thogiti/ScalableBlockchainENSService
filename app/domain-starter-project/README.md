### Highly scalabale and low fees Blockchain ENS Service
This project demonstrates a basic Blockchain based ENS (Ethgereum Name Service) using Ethereum layer 2 protocol Polygon and Hardhat development framework. It comes with Domains smart contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

You can access the Polygon ENS Service at [https://scalableblockchainensservice.vyking.repl.co/](https://scalableblockchainensservice.vyking.repl.co/)
