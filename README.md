# Highly scalabale and low fees Blockchain ENS Service

This project demonstrates a basic Blockchain based ENS (Ethgereum Name Service) using Ethereum layer 2 protocol Polygon and Hardhat development framework. It comes with Domains smart contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

You can access the Web3 decentralized application at https://domain-starter-project.vyking.repl.co/
Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat help
```
